Hello everyone,



This is the second task of the Codsoft internship that I had been given in the Data Science field. This task is on the IMDB movie ratings dataset whose csv you can find in this repository. I had to predict the ratings of the movies.



The variables or columns present in the dataset are- Name, Year, Duration, Genre, Rating, Votes, Director, Actor 1, Actor 2 and Actor 3. I have used this colimns and the information present in them to find out the predictions.



This project uses the Linear Regression algorithm as well as the data science steps such as analysis, preprocessing, visualization, feature engineering, modeling and evaluation to predict the ratings.



Results- Mean Squared Error: 1.65,
R2 Score: 0.09



Conclusion- This project uses all the neccessary variables provided by the dataset to predict the ratings of the IMDB Indian Movies.
